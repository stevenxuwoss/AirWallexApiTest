This is demo for Airwallex api test, using Pytest as testframework. Not using JS framework which the document mentioned.

Now i just add one testcase for the bank api, and not using data to drive test case. i think the data driven cannot be able to clearly express the test purpose of test cases and not easy to maintain. 
But if you want to drive the testcases with data, you can add few changes to implement.

First install list of requirements and run pytest in Python environment.

the test report will generator to output folder and one day one report. You can define rule in confgtest.py
